# Home Automation Devices
## Overview
> This is a collection of [ESPHome](https://ESPHome.io) configuration files and code for my various ESP8266 devices that integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).  I am using includes and packages pretty extensively in order to prevent duplication and allow for easy changing of common settings.

> ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems.  For more information checkout [ESPHome.io](https://ESPHome.io).
